    "# Purpose\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook combines several things we've already been doing individually.\n",
    "\n",
    "Its purpose is to obtain download massive amounts of raw chess game data, process it, then delete the downloaded raw files.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Download raw data\n",
    "\n",
    "This will download raw parquet files from HuggingFace's API.\n",
    "\n",
    "Parquet files are 1GB files containing huge sets of Lichess games.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook downloads all of the parquet files for a certain month (usually 60-70 files). They will be automatically deleted after they're processed.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Process the data\n",
    "\n",
    "For each parquet file that is downloaded, this notebook will process the games in the file one by one, extracting useful data for  training our model.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Delete the data\n",
    "\n",
    "After each parquet file is done being processed, it will be deleted from the local disk.\n",
    "\n",
    "These files are 1GB each and we will be downloading hundreds or thousands of them, so deleting them is a must.\n"
