    "# Efficient Database Rebuild - COPY FROM DATABASE\n",
    "\n",
    "## Purpose\n",
    "This notebook rebuilds the database using DuckDB's built-in `COPY FROM DATABASE` command, which is the most efficient method for eliminating fragmentation and bloat.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Problem\n",
    "Our database balloons in size with every transaction due to:\n",
    "- **Versioned updates**: DuckDB stores versioned updates and deletes\n",
    "- **No automatic vacuuming**: Space isn't automatically reclaimed\n",
    "- **Fragmentation**: Deleted records leave behind empty space\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Solution\n",
    "DuckDB's `COPY FROM DATABASE` is designed specifically for this purpose. It:\n",
    "- Creates a fresh, clean copy of the entire database\n",
    "- Eliminates all fragmentation in one operation\n",
    "- Is much faster than row-by-row copying\n",
    "- Maintains all indexes, constraints, and schema\n",
    "\n",
    "## Process Overview\n",
    "1. **Verify** original database exists and log statistics\n",
    "2. **Create** empty new database file\n",
    "3. **Attach** both databases\n",
    "4. **Copy** entire contents using `COPY FROM DATABASE`\n",
    "5. **Verify** data integrity and statistics match\n",
    "6. **Replace** old database with new one\n",
    "\n",
    "## Advantages Over Manual Copying (Notebook 24)\n",
    "- ‚úÖ **Much faster**: Built-in optimization\n",
    "- ‚úÖ **Simpler**: Single command vs. multiple table copies\n",
    "- ‚úÖ **Less code**: Fewer opportunities for errors\n",
    "- ‚úÖ **Preserves everything**: All schema details maintained automatically"
