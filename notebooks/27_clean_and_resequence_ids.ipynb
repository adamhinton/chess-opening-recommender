    "# Clean Database and Resequence IDs\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook cleans up the database by removing players with NaN ratings and prepares the data for Matrix Factorization by resequencing IDs.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "After fetching ratings in notebook 26, we discovered 82 players with NaN ratings. These are players who deleted their accounts between our data collection and rating fetch. This could indicate cheating or other issues, so we want to remove them entirely.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, Matrix Factorization requires sequential integer IDs starting from 0 or 1. Our current IDs have gaps due to deletions and may not be sequential.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "### Part 1: Delete Players with NaN Ratings (Implemented in this notebook)\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Identify NaN players** - Fetch all players where rating IS NULL\n",
    "   - Safety check: Verify we have exactly 82 players (expected count)\n",
    "   - If count doesn't match, stop for manual review\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Delete their stats** - Remove all `player_opening_stats` entries for these players\n",
    "   - We delete stats first to avoid foreign key constraint issues\n",
    "   - Commit this transaction separately\n",
    "   - This two-step approach prevents issues we encountered with bulk deletions\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Delete the players** - Remove the player records themselves\n",
    "   - Done in a separate transaction after stats deletion\n",
    "   - Commit to make changes permanent\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Verification** - Comprehensive checks to ensure data integrity\n",
    "   - Verify exactly 49,918 players remain (50,000 - 82)\n",
    "   - Confirm no NULL ratings exist\n",
    "   - Spot-check that deleted usernames are truly gone\n",
    "   - Display statistics about the cleaned database\n",
    "\n",
    "### Part 2: Resequence IDs for Matrix Factorization (TODO - Not implemented yet)\n",
    "\n",
    "These steps are documented here but will be implemented later:\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Resequence Player IDs**\n",
    "   - Create a mapping of old player IDs to new sequential IDs (1, 2, 3, ...)\n",
    "   - Update all `player_opening_stats` partitioned tables to use new player IDs\n",
    "   - Update the `player` table with new IDs\n",
    "   - Extensive verification with random spot checks\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Resequence Opening IDs**\n",
    "   - Create a mapping of old opening IDs to new sequential IDs (1, 2, 3, ...)\n",
    "   - Update all `player_opening_stats` partitioned tables to use new opening IDs\n",
    "   - Update the `opening` table with new IDs\n",
    "   - Extensive verification with random spot checks\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Note about player_opening_stats**\n",
    "   - We do NOT need to resequence `player_opening_stats` entries themselves\n",
    "   - These are composite key records (player_id, opening_id, color)\n",
    "   - Only the player_id and opening_id columns need updating (done in steps 4-5)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why This Matters\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Data Quality**: Players who deleted accounts may have been cheaters\n",
    "- **Model Requirements**: MF algorithms expect sequential integer IDs with no gaps\n",
    "- **Data Integrity**: Critical that player-opening relationships remain intact\n",
    "- **Verification**: Extensive checks ensure we don't corrupt the dataset"
