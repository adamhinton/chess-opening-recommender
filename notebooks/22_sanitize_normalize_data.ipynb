    "# Data Sanitization and Normalization\n",
    "\n",
    "## Purpose\n",
    "This notebook is designed to sanitize and normalize the chess database by removing inefficiencies, redundancies, and outliers that could negatively impact the quality of opening recommendations. The goal is to clean up the data while preserving the most valuable information for the chess opening recommender system.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Areas of Focus\n",
    "- **Redundant Opening Names**: Consolidate openings that share the same name but have different ECO codes\n",
    "- **Data Inefficiencies**: Remove or consolidate records that provide minimal analytical value\n",
    "- **Outliers**: Identify and handle extreme cases that might skew recommendations\n",
    "- **Database Optimization**: Reduce storage footprint while maintaining data integrity\n",
    "\n",
    "## Process Overview\n",
    "1. **Baseline Analysis**: Establish current database statistics and size metrics\n",
    "2. **Identify Redundancies**: Find opening names with multiple ECO codes\n",
    "3. **Data Consolidation**: Merge redundant records while preserving statistical accuracy\n",
    "4. **Quality Validation**: Verify that changes maintain data integrity\n",
    "5. **Performance Optimization**: Measure improvements in database size and query performance\n",
    "\n",
    "This systematic approach ensures that the database becomes more efficient and reliable for generating chess opening recommendations."

    "\n",
    "### Process Overview:\n",
    "1. **Select Target Variant**: For each duplicated opening name, choose the ECO code with the most games as the consolidation target\n",
    "2. **Merge Player Statistics**: Combine all player stats from source variants into the target variant\n",
    "3. **Handle Player Overlaps**: If a player has stats for multiple ECO variants of the same opening+color, sum their wins/draws/losses\n",
    "4. **Preserve Data Integrity**: Ensure no games are lost and all statistics remain accurate\n",
    "5. **Clean Database**: Remove empty opening records and orphaned statistics\n",
    "\n",
    "### Safety Measures:\n",
    "- Validate total games before/after to ensure no data loss\n",
    "- Use transactions to allow rollback if issues occur\n",
    "- Log all consolidation actions for transparency\n",
