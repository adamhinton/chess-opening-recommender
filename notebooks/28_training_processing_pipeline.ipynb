    "# Notebook 28 — Opening Recommender Model: Training Pipeline\n",
    "\n",
    "### 0. Overview and Goals\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook defines the full pipeline for training the chess opening recommender model.\n",
    "The objective is to predict **player–opening performance scores** ((wins + (0.5 * draws) / num games)) for openings a player hasn’t yet played, based on their results in the openings they *have* played.\n",
    "\n",
    "The model will use **matrix factorization** with **stochastic gradient descent (SGD)** to learn latent factors representing player and opening characteristics.\n",
    "All computations will be implemented in **PyTorch**, with data loaded from my local **DuckDB** database.\n",
    "\n",
    "**High-level specs:**\n",
    "- Use only *White* openings initially (we’ll extend to Black later).\n",
    "- Data source: processed player–opening stats from local DuckDB.\n",
    "- Predict: normalized “score” = win rate ((wins + 0.5 x draws) / total games).\n",
    "- Filter: only include entries with ≥ `MIN_GAMES_THRESHOLD` (default = 10).\n",
    "- Ignore: rating differences, time controls, and other metadata for the base model.\n",
    "- Model parameters (to be defined in appropriate places for easy editing):\n",
    "  - `NUM_FACTORS`, `LEARNING_RATE`, `BATCH_SIZE`, `N_EPOCHS`, `NUM_PLAYERS_TO_PROCESS`\n",
    "- Logging and checkpoints throughout for reproducibility.\n",
    "- All random operations seeded for deterministic runs.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Data Extraction\n",
    "- Connect to local DuckDB and pull all processed player–opening statistics.\n",
    "- Verify schema consistency and include row-count sanity checks.\n",
    "- Filter for players with ratings above a minimum threshold (e.g., 1200).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Data Sanitization & Normalization\n",
    "- Apply confidence weighting using hierarchical Bayesian shrinkage to adjust scores for low-game-count entries.\n",
    "- Normalize player ratings (z-score) for use as side information.\n",
    "- Resequence player and opening IDs to be contiguous integers for embedding layers.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Data Splits\n",
    "- Split data into train, validation, and test sets (e.g., 75/15/10).\n",
    "- Ensure splits are handled correctly to avoid data leakage.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Enumerate Categorical Variables\n",
    "- Process ECO codes into categorical features (e.g., `eco_letter`, `eco_number`).\n",
    "- Store these as opening-level side information.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Training Data Structure\n",
    "- Convert the final, processed DataFrames into PyTorch Tensors.\n",
    "- Create custom `Dataset` and `DataLoader` classes for efficient batching.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. Cross-Validation & Hyperparameter Tuning\n",
    "- Define ranges for hyperparameters (`NUM_FACTORS`, `LEARNING_RATE`, `BATCH_SIZE`).\n",
    "- Perform k-fold cross-validation on a subset of the training data to find the best hyperparameter combination before the final training run.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7. Final Model Training Setup\n",
    "- Define constants and hyperparameters for the final model (using results from CV).\n",
    "- Instantiate the PyTorch model, optimizer (SGD), and learning rate scheduler.\n",
    "- Implement helper functions for training and evaluation.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 8. Final Model Training Loop\n",
    "- Initialize player and opening embeddings.\n",
    "- Iterate through epochs with mini-batch SGD.\n",
    "- Compute and log training and validation metrics (e.g., RMSE) per epoch.\n",
    "- Save model checkpoints locally.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 9. Evaluation\n",
    "- Evaluate the final trained model on the held-out test set.\n",
    "- Report final metrics (MSE, RMSE) and create visualizations (e.g., predicted vs. actual scores).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 10. Next Steps\n",
    "- Extend model to include Black openings.\n",
    "- Experiment with more complex architectures or hybrid inputs.\n",
    "- Integrate the trained model into an API for serving recommendations.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**Notes:**\n",
    "- Every random seed and parameter definition will be explicit.\n",
    "- Every major step includes row-count, schema, and type validation.\n",
    "- Model artifacts and logs will be saved locally for reproducibility."

    "1. Check if IDs are already sequential (0 or 1-based with no gaps)\n",

    "## 4b. Create ECO Side Information\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why ECO is Side Information:**\n",
    "- ECO codes describe **opening characteristics**, not individual player-opening interactions\n",
    "- Similar to how player ratings describe players, ECO describes openings\n",
    "- Each opening has ONE ECO code (not per player-opening pair)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Implementation Strategy:**\n",
    "- Split ECO codes into two categorical features:\n",
    "  - `eco_letter`: A, B, C, D, or E → encoded as integers 0-4\n",
    "  - `eco_number`: The numeric part (e.g., \"21\" from \"C21\") → encoded as sequential integers\n",
    "- Store in a separate `opening_side_info` lookup table (indexed by opening_id)\n",
    "- Remove `eco` from train/test/val DataFrames (it's not interaction data)\n",
    "- During training, model will lookup opening_id → (eco_letter, eco_number)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why Split ECO into Letter and Number:**\n",
    "- ECO families (A-E) represent fundamentally different opening types:\n",
    "  - **A**: Flank openings (English, Réti, Bird's, etc.)\n",
    "  - **B**: Semi-Open games (Sicilian, French, Caro-Kann, etc.)\n",
    "  - **C**: Open games (King's pawn openings, Spanish, Italian, etc.)\n",
    "  - **D**: Closed games (Queen's Gambit variations)\n",
    "  - **E**: Indian defenses (King's Indian, Nimzo-Indian, etc.)\n",
    "- Numbers within each family represent variations (C20-C29, C30-C39, etc.)\n",
    "- Model can learn separate embeddings for family vs variation\n",
    "\n",
    "**Categorical Encoding:**\n",
    "- Both features will be treated as categorical (not ordinal)\n",
    "- Higher numbers don't mean \"better\" openings\n",
    "- Model will learn embedding vectors for each category\n",
    "- This allows the model to capture non-linear relationships between ECO codes and performance"
