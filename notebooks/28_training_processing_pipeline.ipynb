    "# Notebook 26 — Opening Recommender Model: Training Pipeline\n",
    "\n",
    "### 0. Overview and Goals\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook defines the full pipeline for training the chess opening recommender model.  \n",
    "The objective is to predict **player–opening performance scores** ((wins + (0.5 * draws) / num games)) for openings a player hasn’t yet played, based on their results in the openings they *have* played.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The model will use **matrix factorization** with **stochastic gradient descent (SGD)** to learn latent factors representing player and opening characteristics.  \n",
    "All computations will be implemented in **PyTorch**, with data loaded from my local **DuckDB** database.\n",
    "\n",
    "**High-level specs:**\n",
    "- Use only *White* openings initially (we’ll extend to Black later).  \n",
    "- Data source: processed player–opening stats from local DuckDB.  \n",
    "- Predict: normalized “score” = win rate ((wins + 0.5 x draws) / total games).  \n",
    "- Filter: only include entries with ≥ `MIN_GAMES_THRESHOLD` (default = 50).  \n",
    "- Ignore: rating differences, time controls, and other metadata.  \n",
    "- Model parameters (to be defined in appropriate places for easy editing):  \n",
    "  - `NUM_FACTORS`, `LEARNING_RATE`, `BATCH_SIZE`, `N_EPOCHS`, `NUM_PLAYERS_TO_PROCESS`  \n",
    "- Logging and checkpoints throughout for reproducibility.  \n",
    "- All random operations seeded for deterministic runs.  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Data Extraction\n",
    "- Connect to local DuckDB\n",
    "- Pull all processed player–opening statistics from\n",
    "- Verify schema consistency:  \n",
    "  - Required columns: `player_id`, `opening_id`, `eco`, `num_games`, `wins`, `draws`, `losses`.  \n",
    "- Include a row-count sanity check.\n",
    "- Only players with ratings above 1200\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Data Sanitization & Normalization\n",
    "- Optionally normalize scores if needed for MF convergence.  \n",
    "- Drop players with no qualifying openings and openings with no qualifying players.  \n",
    "  - I believe there shouldn't be any but we'll double check.\n",
    "- Resequence player_id and opening_id to be sequential integers - right now there are gaps because of entries we deleted from the DB \n",
    "- Check for sparsity consistency (no implicit zeros yet).  \n",
    "- Note that this data has already been split in to white and black games further up the pipeline\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Quality\n",
    "- Drop entries with fewer than `MIN_GAMES_THRESHOLD` games\n",
    "- Handle any duplicate `(player_id, opening_id)` combinations\n",
    "- Remove players with no qualifying openings\n",
    "- Remove openings with no qualifying players\n",
    "- Verify no null values remain\n",
    "\n",
    "### ECO Codes\n",
    "- Keep ECO codes for later categorical encoding (Step 4)\n",
    "- ECO will be used as opening side information (similar to rating for players)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Confidence Weighting\n",
    "- Use `MIN_GAMES_THRESHOLD = 10` to keep more data\n",
    "- Add a **confidence weight** column: `confidence = num_games / (num_games + K)` where K ≈ 50\n",
    "- This weight will be used in the loss function to down-weight uncertain predictions\n",
    "- High-game-count entries → high confidence → larger loss impact\n",
    "- Low-game-count entries → low confidence → smaller loss impact\n",
    "\n",
    "### Player Rating (Side Information)\n",
    "- **Player ratings are side information** - they describe player characteristics, not individual player-opening interactions\n",
    "- Ratings will be stored separately and joined to player embeddings during training\n",
    "- We'll **normalize ratings** (likely z-score normalization) to avoid scaling issues with the embedding layer\n",
    "- Rating normalization will be done once after extraction, not per-row\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Data Splits\n",
    "- Split into train/test/val sets.  \n",
    "- Ensure every player and every opening appears at least once in the training data.  \n",
    "- Strategy:  \n",
    "  - Sample unique players and openings to guarantee coverage in train.  \n",
    "  - Remaining data → stratified random split into train/test.  \n",
    "  - Deduplicate and merge unique IDs back into train if needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Enumerate Categorical Variables\n",
    "- Enumerate `eco` (if included) as an integer categorical variable.  \n",
    "- Confirm all columns are numeric and compatible with PyTorch tensors.  \n",
    "- Verify no missing or out-of-range IDs.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Training Data Structure\n",
    "- Each row: one `(player_id, opening_id, score)` record.\n",
    "- Include other fields- eco, num games etc\n",
    "- Convert DataFrame to PyTorch tensors (`torch.long` for IDs, `torch.float` for scores).  \n",
    "- Log dataset shapes and sparsity metrics.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. Training Setup\n",
    "Define constants:\n",
    "- `LEARNING_RATE`, `BATCH_SIZE`, `N_EPOCHS`, `NUM_FACTORS`  \n",
    "- Loss functions: MSE and RMSE  \n",
    "- Activation: sigmoid or none (depending on score normalization)  \n",
    "- Optimizer: SGD  \n",
    "- Figure out if there's anything else we need to design or specify\n",
    "\n",
    "Implement helper functions:\n",
    "- `train_one_epoch()`\n",
    "- `evaluate_model()`\n",
    "- `calculate_rmse()`\n",
    "- `save_checkpoint()`  \n",
    "\n",
    "Ensure detailed logging, ETA reporting, and reproducible random seeds.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7. Training Loop\n",
    "- Initialize player and opening embeddings.  \n",
    "- Iterate through epochs with mini-batch SGD (`BATCH_SIZE = 1024`).  \n",
    "- Compute and log MSE/RMSE per epoch.  \n",
    "- Save model checkpoints locally after each epoch.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 8. Evaluation\n",
    "- Evaluate on test set.  \n",
    "- Report MSE, RMSE, and visual diagnostics (predicted vs actual score).  \n",
    "- Inspect a few player and opening latent factors for sanity.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 9. Cross-Validation & Hyperparameter Tuning\n",
    "- Define ranges for:  \n",
    "  - `NUM_FACTORS`, `LEARNING_RATE`, `BATCH_SIZE`, `N_EPOCHS`  \n",
    "- Perform small-scale grid or random search for best configuration.  \n",
    "- Compare validation RMSE across runs.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 10. Next Steps\n",
    "- Extend model to include Black openings.  \n",
    "- Experiment with hybrid inputs (player rating, ECO grouping).  \n",
    "- Consider implicit feedback handling (unplayed openings as zeros).  \n",
    "- Integrate trained model into API for recommendation output.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**Notes:**  \n",
    "- Every random seed and parameter definition will be explicit.  \n",
    "- Every major step includes row-count, schema, and type validation.  \n",
    "- Model artifacts and logs will be saved locally for reproducibility.\n"

    "\n",
    "**Why ECO is Side Information:**\n",
    "- ECO codes describe **opening characteristics**, not individual player-opening interactions\n",
    "- Similar to how player ratings describe players, ECO describes openings\n",
    "- Each opening has ONE ECO code (not per player-opening pair)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Implementation Strategy:**\n",
    "- Split ECO codes into two categorical features:\n",
    "  - `eco_letter`: A, B, C, D, or E → encoded as integers 0-4\n",
    "  - `eco_number`: The numeric part (e.g., \"21\" from \"C21\") → encoded as sequential integers\n",
    "- Store in a separate `opening_side_info` lookup table (indexed by opening_id)\n",
    "- Remove `eco` from train/test/val DataFrames (it's not interaction data)\n",
    "- During training, model will lookup opening_id → (eco_letter, eco_number)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why Split ECO into Letter and Number:**\n",
    "- ECO families (A-E) represent fundamentally different opening types:\n",
    "  - **A**: Flank openings (English, Réti, Bird's, etc.)\n",
    "  - **B**: Semi-Open games (Sicilian, French, Caro-Kann, etc.)\n",
    "  - **C**: Open games (King's pawn openings, Spanish, Italian, etc.)\n",
    "  - **D**: Closed games (Queen's Gambit variations)\n",
    "  - **E**: Indian defenses (King's Indian, Nimzo-Indian, etc.)\n",
    "- Numbers within each family represent variations (C20-C29, C30-C39, etc.)\n",
    "- Model can learn separate embeddings for family vs variation\n",
    "\n",
    "**Categorical Encoding:**\n",
    "- Both features will be treated as categorical (not ordinal)\n",
    "- Higher numbers don't mean \"better\" openings\n",
    "- Model will learn embedding vectors for each category\n",
    "- This allows the model to capture non-linear relationships between ECO codes and performance"
