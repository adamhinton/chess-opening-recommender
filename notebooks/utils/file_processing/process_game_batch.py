# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# This module is responsible for processing a single batch of chess games. It
# filters games based on defined criteria, extracts relevant information, and
# efficiently updates a DuckDB database with player and opening statistics.
#
#   Aggregated stats are routed to partitioned tables by ECO first letter (A-E, other)
#   - A helper function determines the correct table for each ECO code
#   - This improves write performance and future query flexibility

# Note: WHen a player already has stats for a given opening, we update the existing row rather than inserting a new one. So we add to rows such as num_losses etc. -------------------------------------------------------------
