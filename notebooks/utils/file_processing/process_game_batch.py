# This module is responsible for processing a single batch of chess games. It
# filters games based on defined criteria, extracts relevant information, and
# efficiently updates a DuckDB database with player and opening statistics.
#
# Partitioning update (2025-09-14):
#   - Aggregated stats are now routed to partitioned tables by ECO first letter (A-E, other)
#   - A helper function determines the correct table for each ECO code
#   - This improves write performance and future query flexibility
