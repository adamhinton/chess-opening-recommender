    "# Verification of Shrunken Database\n",
    "\n",
    "**Purpose:** To verify the data integrity of the shrunken database (`chess_games_shrunk.db`) by comparing it against the original database (`chess_games.db`).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Methodology:**\n",
    "1.  **Aggregate Count Comparison:** Check if the total number of records in the `player`, `opening`, and partitioned `player_opening_stats` tables are identical between the two databases.\n",
    "2.  **ID Mapping Reconstruction:** Recreate the logic used to map old, non-sequential IDs to new, sequential IDs.\n",
    "3.  **Random Spot Checks:**\n",
    "    *   Select 200 random players and openings from the original database.\n",
    "    *   Find their corresponding records in the new database using the reconstructed ID mappings.\n",
    "    *   Verify that their core data (name, title, eco) is identical.\n",
    "4.  **Stats Record Spot Check:**\n",
    "    *   Select 200 random records from one of the `player_opening_stats` partitions in the original database.\n",
    "    *   Find the corresponding records in the new database by mapping both `player_id` and `opening_id`.\n",
    "    *   Verify that the game statistics (`num_wins`, `num_draws`, `num_losses`) and `color` are identical.\n",
    "\n",
    "This process will provide strong evidence that the shrinking process was successful and lossless."

    "If all checks above passed, we can be highly confident that the database shrinking process was successful and did not result in data loss. The size reduction is primarily due to:\n",
    "1.  **Rebuilding the file:** Exporting to Parquet and re-importing into a new file eliminates all historical data bloat and fragmentation from past transactions (the biggest factor).\n",
    "2.  **Sequential Primary Keys:** Using sequential integers for IDs is slightly more space-efficient than using non-sequential ones, though this is a minor factor compared to rebuilding.\n",
    "3.  **Data Type Optimization:** Changing `VARCHAR` to a 1-byte `ENUM` for the `color` column and `INTEGER` to `SMALLINT` for `num_draws` saves several bytes per record across millions of rows, adding up to a significant saving."

    "### A Note on Longevity: Will These Optimizations Last?\n",
    "\n",
    "That's an excellent and important question. The answer is mixed, as different optimizations have different lifespans:\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Data Type Changes (Permanent Savings):**\n",
    "\n",
    "*   The change from `VARCHAR` to `ENUM` for the `color` column and `INTEGER` to `SMALLINT` for `num_draws` is a **permanent optimization**.\n",
    "*   These changes are now part of the table's schema. Every new row added to the database *must* use these smaller, more efficient data types.\n",
    "*   The savings from this will persist and scale with any new data you add.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. File Overhead / Bloat (Temporary Fix):**\n",
    "\n",
    "*   The ~1.0 GB of savings from eliminating file overhead is **temporary**.\n",
    "*   As you `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, and `DELETE` data, DuckDB will once again accumulate transactional history and fragmentation. This is normal and expected behavior for maintaining ACID compliance and performance.\n",
    "*   The database file will inevitably grow larger than the raw data it contains. However, it's unlikely to bloat as dramatically as the original file unless you perform millions of small transactions or large-scale `ALTER` operations again.\n",
    "*   The export/re-import process performed in the `19_shrink_db.ipynb` notebook can be considered a **maintenance task** that you can run periodically (e.g., every few months or after major data loads) if file size becomes a concern again.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Perfect Alphabetical ID Sorting (One-Time Fix):**\n",
    "\n",
    "*   The perfect physical sorting of data on disk was a **one-time benefit** of creating the tables from scratch with an `ORDER BY` clause.\n",
    "*   When you `INSERT` new data, DuckDB will typically append it to the end of the table files. It **will not** automatically re-sort the entire table on disk to maintain that perfect physical order, as that would be extremely inefficient for write operations.\n",
    "*   **However, this is not a major concern.** The indexes on your primary key columns will maintain a *logical* sort order, ensuring that lookups and joins remain fast. The benefit of the initial physical sort was mainly about achieving maximum data compression and a slightly more efficient initial layout, but its absence for new data won't significantly degrade performance for typical queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "**In summary:** The most significant part of the optimization (data types) is permanent. The largest part (file bloat) is temporary but manageable with occasional maintenance. The physical sorting was a one-time bonus that is not critical to maintain."
