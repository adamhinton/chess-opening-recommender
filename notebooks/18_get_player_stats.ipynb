    "# Database Performance Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "### Purpose of this Notebook\n",
    "Our data processing pipeline is experiencing a significant slowdown in write performance. After processing about 20 parquet files, the rate of inserting game statistics has dropped from ~140k games/sec to ~70k games/sec. This notebook aims to diagnose the potential causes of this degradation by thoroughly inspecting the state of our `chess_games.db` DuckDB database.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will investigate:\n",
    "- **Database Size**: How large is the database file?\n",
    "- **Table Counts**: How many players, openings, and player-opening stats entries have we accumulated?\n",
    "- **Partition Health**: How is the data distributed across our partitioned `player_opening_stats` tables? An imbalance could indicate a performance bottleneck.\n",
    "- **Data Skew**: Are a few players or openings responsible for a disproportionate number of records? This could strain the primary key lookups during `UPSERT` operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "By understanding the shape and size of our data, we can better identify whether the slowdown is a temporary issue that will level off or a systemic problem that requires architectural changes."

    "Based on the statistics above, we can draw some preliminary conclusions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Scale**: Are the tables growing to a size where DuckDB's `UPSERT` performance is known to degrade? (Typically in the hundreds of millions or billions of rows).\n",
    "- **Balance**: Is the data evenly distributed across partitions, or is one partition taking most of the load? A heavily skewed partition might benefit from further sub-partitioning.\n",
    "- **Skew**: Are a few players or openings dominating the stats table? If so, the constant updates to these \"hot\" records could be the primary source of the slowdown.\n",
    "\n",
    "If significant skew is detected, we might need to reconsider our processing strategy. For example, we could batch updates by player or opening to reduce contention, or explore alternative data structures. If the issue is purely scale, we may need to accept the performance curve or explore more heavy-duty database solutions."
