    "# Database Performance Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "### Purpose of this Notebook\n",
    "Our data processing pipeline is experiencing a significant slowdown in write performance. After processing about 20 parquet files, the rate of inserting game statistics has dropped from ~140k games/sec to ~70k games/sec. This notebook aims to diagnose the potential causes of this degradation by thoroughly inspecting the state of our `chess_games.db` DuckDB database.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will investigate:\n",
    "- **Database Size**: How large is the database file?\n",
    "- **Table Counts**: How many players, openings, and player-opening stats entries have we accumulated?\n",
    "- **Partition Health**: How is the data distributed across our partitioned `player_opening_stats` tables? An imbalance could indicate a performance bottleneck.\n",
    "- **Data Skew**: Are a few players or openings responsible for a disproportionate number of records? This could strain the primary key lookups during `UPSERT` operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "By understanding the shape and size of our data, we can better identify whether the slowdown is a temporary issue that will level off or a systemic problem that requires architectural changes."

    "- **Scale**: Are the tables growing to a size where DuckDB's `UPSERT` performance is known to degrade? (Typically in the hundreds of millions or billions of rows).\n",
    "- **Balance**: Is the data evenly distributed across partitions, or is one partition taking most of the load? A heavily skewed partition might benefit from further sub-partitioning.\n",

For example, we could batch updates by player or opening to reduce contention, or explore alternative data structures.
