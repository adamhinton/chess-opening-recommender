    "# Notebook 29 — Inference Pipeline: Predicting Opening Performance for New Players\n",
    "\n",
    "## Purpose\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates the complete inference pipeline for making opening recommendations to players **not** in our training set.\n",
    "We use the 1,000 holdout players (reserved in notebook 28) to validate our approach before deploying to production.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Production Use**: This pipeline will be used on the website to:\n",
    "- Fetch a player's game history from the Lichess API\n",
    "- Transform their opening statistics into model-ready features\n",
    "- Generate personalized opening recommendations\n",
    "- Display predictions with confidence scores\n",
    "\n",
    "**Development Focus**: We're building **granular, reusable functions** that can be easily adapted from local DB testing to production API integration.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Pipeline Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **Load Holdout Player Data**\n",
    "- Select a holdout player from the database (never seen during training)\n",
    "- Extract their complete opening statistics (wins, draws, losses per opening)\n",
    "- Retrieve player metadata (rating, name, etc.)\n",
    "- Verify data quality and completeness\n",
    "- Will use the same player every time this is run, for testing\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Transform Data for Model Input**\n",
    "- Calculate raw performance scores: `(wins + 0.5 × draws) / total_games`\n",
    "- Completely ignore openings not in training set\n",
    "    - We got rid of those for good reasons, not helpful/unrepresentative/too generic\n",
    "- Apply hierarchical Bayesian shrinkage toward opening-specific means\n",
    "- Normalize player rating using training set parameters (z-score)\n",
    "- Remap database IDs to training IDs (sequential 0-based indices)\n",
    "- Encode ECO codes into categorical features (letter and number)\n",
    "- Convert to PyTorch tensors\n",
    "    - player id (not sure this is needed), opening ids, eco letters and numbers, rating_z\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **Generate Predictions**\n",
    "- Load trained model and all required artifacts (mappings, normalization params, etc.)\n",
    "- Feed transformed data through the model\n",
    "- Generate predicted performance scores for all valid openings\n",
    "- Separate predictions into: openings player has played vs. new recommendations\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. **Analyze and Display Results**\n",
    "- Compare predictions to actual performance (for openings player has played)\n",
    "- Rank and display top opening recommendations\n",
    "- Visualize prediction quality and confidence\n",
    "- Save predictions for later analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**: This notebook only performs inference—the model weights remain fixed. We are validating the deployment pipeline, not retraining.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note about one possible issue**: I believe we will need opening statistics from the training data to perform Bayesian shrinkage on win rates. We may not have that readily available; I'll need to double check our artifacts. But it should be fairly easy to compile."
