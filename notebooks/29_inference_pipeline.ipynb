    "# Notebook 29 — Inference Pipeline: Predicting Opening Performance for New Players\n",
    "\n",
    "## Purpose\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates the complete inference pipeline for making opening recommendations to players **not** in our training set.\n",
    "We use the 1,000 holdout players (reserved in notebook 28) to validate our approach before deploying to production.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Production Use**: This pipeline will be used on the website to:\n",
    "- Fetch a player's game history from the Lichess API\n",
    "    - Note that for the testing in this notebook, we're just getting an untouched holdout player from our local DB.\n",
    "- Transform their opening statistics into model-ready features\n",
    "- Generate personalized opening recommendations\n",
    "- Display predictions with confidence scores\n",
    "\n",
    "**Development Focus**: We're building **granular, reusable functions** that can be easily adapted from local DB testing to production API integration.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Pipeline Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **Load Holdout Player Data**\n",
    "- Select a holdout player from the database (never seen during training)\n",
    "- Extract their complete opening statistics (wins, draws, losses per opening)\n",
    "- Retrieve player metadata (rating, name, etc.)\n",
    "- Verify data quality and completeness\n",
    "- Will use the same player every time this is run, for testing\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Transform Data for Model Input**\n",
    "- Calculate raw performance scores: `(wins + 0.5 × draws) / total_games`\n",
    "- Completely ignore openings not in training set\n",
    "    - We got rid of those for good reasons, not helpful/unrepresentative/too generic\n",
    "- Apply hierarchical Bayesian shrinkage toward opening-specific means\n",
    "- Normalize player rating using training set parameters (z-score)\n",
    "- Remap database IDs to training IDs (sequential 0-based indices)\n",
    "- Encode ECO codes into categorical features (letter and number)\n",
    "- Convert to PyTorch tensors\n",
    "    - player id (not sure this is needed), opening ids, eco letters and numbers, rating_z\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **Generate Predictions**\n",
    "- Load trained model and all required artifacts (mappings, normalization params, etc.)\n",
    "- Feed transformed data through the model\n",
    "- Generate predicted performance scores for all valid openings\n",
    "- Separate predictions into: openings player has played vs. new recommendations\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. **Analyze and Display Results**\n",
    "- Compare predictions to actual performance (for openings player has played)\n",
    "- Rank and display top opening recommendations\n",
    "- Visualize prediction quality and confidence\n",
    "- Save predictions for later analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**: This notebook only performs inference—the model weights remain fixed. We are validating the deployment pipeline, not retraining.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note about one possible issue**: I believe we will need opening statistics from the training data to perform Bayesian shrinkage on win rates. We may not have that readily available; I'll need to double check our artifacts. But it should be fairly easy to compile."

    "## Required Model Artifacts\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook (and in production), we will need to load various model artifact files to help in data processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "I currently believe that we only need very small files (< 1MB total), which is very doable on the client or server.\n",
    "\n",
    "From the trained model's artifact directory, we'll need:\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Core Model & Mappings**\n",
    "- **`best_model.pt`** (8.3 MB) - Trained PyTorch model weights for inference\n",
    "- **Note**: Need to make sure we're using a valid player id, if any. It might have to be the next sequential player id that the model's dataset would expect? Not sure, need to investigate.\n",
    "- **`opening_id_mappings.json`** (96 KB) - Maps database opening IDs → training IDs (0-based sequential)\n",
    "  - *Why*: Same as above - embeddings require contiguous indices\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Normalization & Encoding**\n",
    "- **`rating_normalization.json`** (4 KB) - Contains `rating_mean` and `rating_std` from training\n",
    "  - *Why*: Must normalize new player ratings with exact same parameters: `z = (rating - mean) / std`\n",
    "- **`eco_encodings.json`** (4 KB) - Maps ECO codes to integers (letter: A-E → 0-4, numbers → sequential ints)\n",
    "  - *Why*: Model expects categorical integers, not raw ECO strings like \"B02\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Model Configuration**\n",
    "- **`hyperparameters.json`** (4 KB) - NUM_FACTORS (40), NUM_PLAYERS, NUM_OPENINGS, embedding dimensions\n",
    "  - *Why*: Need exact architecture specs to instantiate the model correctly\n",
    "- **`model_architecture.json`** (4 KB) - Complete model structure details\n",
    "  - *Why*: Documents the model class and layer configurations\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Reference Data**\n",
    "- **`opening_mappings.csv`** (168 KB) - Full opening metadata (db_id, training_id, eco, name)\n",
    "  - *Why*: Look up opening details when displaying recommendations\n",
    "- **`holdout_players.csv`** (24 KB) - List of 1,000 holdout player IDs for testing\n",
    "  - *Why*: Select test players that were never seen during training\n",
    "\n",
    "### **⚠️ Missing Artifact (Need to Create)**\n",
    "- **`opening_stats.json`** or **`.csv`** - Opening-specific statistics from training data\n",
    "  - Should contain: `opening_id`, `mean_score`, `total_games`, `num_players`\n",
    "  - *Why*: Required for hierarchical Bayesian shrinkage during inference\n",
    "  - *Status*: **Not currently saved** - we'll need to generate this from notebook 28's training data\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**Total artifact size**: <1MB currently. I'm not sure if opening_stats.json will be large and unwieldy (assuming we even need it) but I don't think so."
