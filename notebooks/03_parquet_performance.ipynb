    "# Parquet Data Performance Testing\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook measures performance metrics for processing chess game data from parquet files. The main objectives are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Efficiently load data from parquet files using DuckDB\n",
    "2. Process the data to gather player statistics and opening preferences\n",
    "3. Log detailed performance metrics (games/sec, processing time, etc.)\n",
    "4. Compare with the performance of processing PGN files directly\n",
    "\n",
    "Update: This notebook seems to do a great job of parsing games quickly. Now we are moving on to better filtering.\n",
    "\n",
    "NOTE If you want to quickly adjust games filtering or processing parameters, ProcessingConfig is probably your best bet. I put as many relevant parameters in there as I could think of."

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "The parquet approach demonstrates significant performance advantages over the PGN processing approach:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Data access**: Parquet's columnar format allows us to load only the fields we need\n",
    "2. **Batch processing**: We can efficiently process data in memory-optimized batches\n",
    "3. **Parallelization**: Multiple CPU cores can be used effectively with minimal overhead\n",
    "4. **No parsing overhead**: Unlike PGN files, we don't need to parse text files or decompress data\n",
    "\n",
    "For large datasets, the parquet approach can be 10-100x faster than processing PGN files directly, making it much more suitable for processing millions of chess games.\n",
