    "# Parquet Data Performance Testing\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook measures performance metrics for processing chess game data from parquet files. The main objectives are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Efficiently load data from parquet files using DuckDB\n",
    "2. Process the data to gather player statistics and opening preferences\n",
    "3. Log detailed performance metrics (games/sec, processing time, etc.)\n",
    "4. Compare with the performance of processing PGN files directly\n",
    "\n",
    "Update: This notebook seems to do a great job of parsing games quickly. Now we are moving on to better filtering.\n",
    "\n",
    "NOTE If you want to quickly adjust games filtering or processing parameters, ProcessingConfig is probably your best bet. I put as many relevant parameters in there as I could think of."

    "\n",
    "To process multiple parquet files:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Run the cell above that calls `process_multiple_files()`\n",
    "2. A directory picker dialog will appear - select the folder containing your parquet files\n",
    "3. The utility will identify new files (not previously processed) and process them one by one\n",
    "4. All player statistics will be merged into a combined dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "You can keep adding new parquet files to the same directory, and when you run this notebook again it will only process the new ones. This is perfect for incrementally adding to your dataset over time."
