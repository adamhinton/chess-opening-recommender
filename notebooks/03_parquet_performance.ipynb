    "# Parquet Data Performance Testing\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook measures performance metrics for processing chess game data from parquet files. The main objectives are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Efficiently load data from parquet files using DuckDB\n",
    "2. Process the data to gather player statistics and opening preferences\n",
    "3. Log detailed performance metrics (games/sec, processing time, etc.)\n",
    "4. Compare with the performance of processing PGN files directly\n",
    "\n",
    "Update: This notebook seems to do a great job of parsing games quickly. Now we are moving on to better filtering.\n",
    "\n",
    "NOTE If you want to quickly adjust games filtering or processing parameters, ProcessingConfig is probably your best bet. I put as many relevant parameters in there as I could think of."

    "To process multiple parquet files:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Run the cell above that calls `process_multiple_files()`\n",
    "2. A directory picker dialog will appear - select the folder containing your parquet files\n",
    "3. The utility will identify new files (not previously processed) and process them one by one\n",
    "4. All player statistics will be merged into a combined dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "You can keep adding new parquet files to the same directory, and when you run this notebook again it will only process the new ones. This is perfect for incrementally adding to your dataset over time."

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "The parquet approach demonstrates significant performance advantages over the PGN processing approach:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Data access**: Parquet's columnar format allows us to load only the fields we need\n",
    "2. **Batch processing**: We can efficiently process data in memory-optimized batches\n",
    "3. **Parallelization**: Multiple CPU cores can be used effectively with minimal overhead\n",
    "4. **No parsing overhead**: Unlike PGN files, we don't need to parse text files or decompress data\n",
    "5. **Multi-file processing**: Our new approach lets us process multiple files at once with duplicate detection\n",
    "\n",
    "For large datasets, the parquet approach can be 10-100x faster than processing PGN files directly, making it much more suitable for processing millions of chess games.\n",
    "\n",
    "With our new multi-file processing utility, you can:\n",
    "1. Process many parquet files in one operation\n",
    "2. Automatically detect and skip duplicates\n",
    "3. Continue adding new files to your dataset over time\n",
    "4. Have all statistics automatically merged into a combined dataset"
