    "1. Efficiently load data from parquet files using DuckDB\n",
    "2. Process the data to gather player statistics and opening preferences\n",
    "3. Log detailed performance metrics (games/sec, processing time, etc.)\n",
    "4. Compare with the performance of processing PGN files directly\n",

    "\n",
    "The parquet approach demonstrates significant performance advantages over the PGN processing approach:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Data access**: Parquet's columnar format allows us to load only the fields we need\n",
    "2. **Batch processing**: We can efficiently process data in memory-optimized batches\n",
    "3. **Parallelization**: Multiple CPU cores can be used effectively with minimal overhead\n",
    "4. **No parsing overhead**: Unlike PGN files, we don't need to parse text files or decompress data\n",
    "\n",
    "For large datasets, the parquet approach can be 10-100x faster than processing PGN files directly, making it much more suitable for processing millions of chess games."
