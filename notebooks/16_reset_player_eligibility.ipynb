    "To reset the `is_eligible_account` status for all players in the `player_game_counts` database.\n",

    "# Why?\n",
    "\n",
    "An error in the previous notebook (`15_filter_out_banned_players.ipynb`) caused players to be incorrectly marked as ineligible if the Lichess API call failed for their batch. \n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook will set the `is_eligible_account` column to `NULL` for all records, allowing the corrected pipeline to re-process all players accurately."
