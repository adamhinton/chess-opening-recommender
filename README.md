This is the very beginnings of my chess openings recommendation website. I will build an AI model to examine a user's openings and recommend new openings that they may enjoy and score well with.

There will be two sides to this repo. The AI model side, which hosts the models and notebooks. And the web side, where I build the website that users go to.
